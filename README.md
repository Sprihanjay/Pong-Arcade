# Pong-Arcade

## Pong Game in Python
This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game in Python. The game is built using the pygame library and can be played by two players. The objective of the game is to score points by hitting the ball with the paddles and making it pass the opponent's paddle.

## Getting Started
To play the game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can


install Pygame using pip by running the following command in your terminal:
pip install pygame


Once you have installed Pygame, you can run the game by running the pong.py file in your terminal. The game will open in a new window, and you can use the arrow keys to control the left paddle and the 'W' and 'S' keys to control the right paddle.

## Features
The Pong game implemented in this project includes the following features:

Two-player mode
Simple, responsive controls
Smooth animation
Score tracking for both players
A clean, minimalist user interface
